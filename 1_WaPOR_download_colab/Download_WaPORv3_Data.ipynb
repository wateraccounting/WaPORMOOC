For more information about WaPOR data formats check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm5IAy4MHg4). Removal of the scaling factor increases the file size, for more advanced users, check out the [wapordl package](https://bitbucket.org/cioapps/wapordl/src/main/) created by FAO for more ways to download WaPORv3 data (including an option for downloading 1 file with scaled values in multiple bands for saving space, do note to make sure the scaling factor is applied when utilising such data).\n",
